Explanation to Hash , TRIE , JSON Tags displayed in Redis insight Screen Shot

Imagine Redis OM is building **two different “lookup systems”** for your products:

---

## 1) JSON keys (`products:12`, `products:120` …)

These are your **real product records**.

Think of them like rows in a table:

* key = product id
* value = full product data (name, category, price…)

So Redis stores each product like a small JSON file.

Example:

```
products:12  ->  { "name": "Product 12", "category": "books", "price": 77.61, ... }
```

✅ This is what search returns (`FT.SEARCH`).

---

## 2) TRIE (shown as “TRIETYPE0”) = Autocomplete word list

A **TRIE** is just a **prefix tree** for fast typing suggestions.

Think of your phone keyboard:

* you type “Pro…”
* it quickly suggests “Product 12”, “Product 120”, …

To do that fast, Redis makes a special structure (TRIE) that stores **only names**, not full products.

So this key:

```
sugg:RedisProductEntity:name
```

means:

> “Here is my autocomplete dictionary for product names.”

✅ This is what autocomplete uses.

It doesn’t store category/price — only the suggestion text + score.

---

## 3) HASH = Payload store for autocomplete

A **HASH** in Redis is like a **map/dictionary**:

```
field -> value
```

Redis OM uses this to store **extra info for each suggestion**.

Because you said:

* autocomplete from `name`
* but also return `category` and `price`

So Redis OM stores:

```
"Product 12" -> {"category":"books", "price":77.61}
"Product 120" -> {"category":"electronics", "price":901.55}
...
```

All inside this HASH key:

```
sugg:payload:RedisProductEntity:name
```

✅ When autocomplete runs:

1. TRIE gives suggestion names
2. HASH gives category + price for each suggestion

---

## Short analogy

Think of a bookstore:

* **JSON docs** = full books on shelves
* **TRIE** = a small card index with only book titles for quick lookup
* **HASH** = another card index that says “for this title, its section and price are …”

---

## Super short summary

* **TRIE** = “list of names for suggestions”
* **HASH** = “extra details for those suggestions”
* **JSON** = “actual product objects”

Nothing is wrong — Redis OM is just creating these helper structures automatically for autocomplete + search.
