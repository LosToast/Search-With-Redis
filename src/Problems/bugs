1. “partial-index correctness problem”
-> Redis is not your full search index. It only contains products that happened to be written there from previous searches (because you only saveAll() when Redis returns zero results).
   So Redis ends up being a partial index (incomplete copy of your DB).
   That creates this bug:
   DB has 200 products matching "iphone".
   Redis currently contains only 10 iphone products (because only those were cached earlier).
   Your code searches Redis first → gets 10 results (non-empty) → returns them immediately.
   User sees 10 results even though the “correct” answer is 200.
   That’s “correctness” because the results are wrong/incomplete, not just slow.
