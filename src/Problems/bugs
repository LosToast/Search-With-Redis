1. “partial-index correctness problem”
-> Redis is not your full search index. It only contains products that happened to be written there from previous searches (because you only saveAll() when Redis returns zero results).
   So Redis ends up being a partial index (incomplete copy of your DB).
   That creates this bug:
   DB has 200 products matching "iphone".
   Redis currently contains only 10 iphone products (because only those were cached earlier).
   Your code searches Redis first → gets 10 results (non-empty) → returns them immediately.
   User sees 10 results even though the “correct” answer is 200.
   That’s “correctness” because the results are wrong/incomplete, not just slow.

   Strategies is mentioned in Strigies file

2. When we Search in redis with "Product 1" it always it db query and when searched "Product One" it wont hit db query
    it will fetch from redis

    sol: - What you’re seeing is almost always caused by RediSearch’s prefix-search minimum length.
           Why @name:(Product* 1*) behaves differently from @name:(Product* one*)
           In RediSearch (Redis Stack search), field:(term*) is a prefix query. By default, RediSearch requires the
            prefix to be at least 2 characters long (MINPREFIX default is 2).
            one* ✅ length 3 → valid prefix search → works
            1* ❌ length 1 → too short for prefix search → it won’t expand, so it often won’t match what you expect
            So the issue is not “numeric vs text” by itself—it's that your numeric prefix is only one character.

    How to make search consistent (numeric or text)
    sol -> if you really need 1* : set MINPREFIX to 1
            FT.CONFIG SET MINPREFIX 1

            Option B (recommended): don’t use prefix for single-character numbers
            If the user typed 1, just search it as an exact token, not a prefix:
            Instead of: @name:(Product* 1*)
            Use: @name:(Product* 1)
            If you still want prefix for longer inputs:
            If input length == 1 → exact
            If input length >= 2 → prefix

            Example:
            user: "Product 1" → @name:(Product* 1)
            user: "Product 12" → @name:(Product* 12*)
            user: "Product one" → @name:(Product* one*)
            This gives consistent behavior

            This is a very common approach in autocomplete/search boxes.
